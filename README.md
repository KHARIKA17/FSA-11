Welcome to Location based Game Application.

## Overview

A location based gaming app that helps the user to find the treasure location. First it checks the device coordinates with the target location and tells the user whether he/she is inside or outside the target location. when user clicks/touches on the first color then it provides a valid treasure location and a confirmation message will appear that a particular location is selected.Even after confirmation user is provided with option to select another location, if so the user can start the game from beginning.when the user clicks or touches the second color, if the user is inside the treasure location, user will hear information that a treasure is earned, if the user is outside the target location, user will hear information about help like in direction to walk, how far away or any other clue.

## location logic
- The logic is written inside the function named getLocationDirections in location-quad.js
- Next,sorting the latitudes of a quest location in descending order and the longitudes in ascending order since they are negative. 
- When we have that, compare the first two of these values with the relevant point value e.g. latitude with latitude. In case of latitude, if either of the first two values of sorted quest location's latitude is less than the latitude of the given point then we know that the user is located to the north of quad and have to move towards south to reach the logic. 
- similarly, You can extend this logic to find other locations too.
